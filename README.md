## PyTorch_Tut_01
#### In this notebook I have implemented some fundamental concepts that are required prior learning Pytorch framework.
#### I have also implemented concepts like Creating arange of tensors and tensors-like, Tensor DataTypes, Matrix multiplication.

## PyTorch_Tut_02
#### In this notebook I've showcased how NumPy library is compatible with Pytorch Framework.
#### Brief explaination about what is Reproducibility in PyTorch.
#### Running tensors and and Pytorch objects on the GPUs (and making faster computatiions).
